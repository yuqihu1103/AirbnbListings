**Project Description:** Aiming to demonstate my proficienct in using Javascript and DOM, this page is created to load and display 50 Airbnb listings from a JSON file using AJAX. The page shows the listing name, description, amenities, host (name and photo), price, thumbnail. Also a creative addition was included. In addition, there is a "suprise me" button which will display a mystery listing randomly picked one from the 500 listings for the user.
